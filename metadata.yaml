description: Intrepid pals Bob Holton and Joe Lewis were born with wanderlust pumping
  through their veins. Their fathers are both in charge of landing precious art and
  objects for major institutions in Washington, D.C., and the quest for the world's
  most valuable artifacts takes them -- and their sons -- on adventures around the
  globe. This tale takes the quartet to Brazil, where a jungle trek goes horribly
  awry.
